## 💡 USING THE BRAND IN PRACTICE

### Example: Writing a Homepage Headline

❌ **Wrong (Too Salesy):**
"GET INTO TOP US UNIVERSITIES - 100% GUARANTEED!"

❌ **Wrong (Too Academic):**
"StudyFrontier Educational Services - Est. 2024"

❌ **Wrong (Too Generic):**
"Study Abroad Consultants in Morocco"

✅ **Correct (On-Brand):**
"Your Gateway to U.S. Universities"
*Professional guidance for international students seeking academic excellence abroad*

**Why it works:**
- Aspirational but realistic
- Sophisticated language ("gateway" not "help")
- Professional positioning
- No false promises
- Clear value proposition

### Example: Choosing Logo for Email

**Scenario:** Sending a welcome email to new consultation inquiry

**Background:** White email template

**Correct Logo:** `logo-wordmark-dark.svg`

**Implementation:**
```html
<img src="https://studyfrontier.com/brand/logo-wordmark-dark.svg" 
     alt="StudyFrontier" 
     width="180" 
     height="31"
     style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" />
```
