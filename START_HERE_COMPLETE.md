## 🎓 Training Your Team

### Everyone Should Know:

**The Positioning:**
"We're a selective consultancy, not a high-volume agency. We work with serious, qualified students and provide honest guidance—even if that means saying 'not yet.'"

**The Process:**
"Our 7-step process takes 6-12 months. We don't promise overnight results. We promise thorough, professional guidance."

**The Standards:**
"We adhere to all regulations, work only with accredited universities, and never make guarantees about admission or visas."

**The Differentiation:**
"Quality over quantity. We work with fewer students so each receives the attention they deserve."
