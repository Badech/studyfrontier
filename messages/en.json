    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Transparent answers to common questions about our services",
    "intro": "We believe in complete transparency. Below are honest answers to the most frequently asked questions about our consulting services, fees, timelines, and policies.",
    
    "q1": "Do you guarantee visa approval?",
    "a1": "No. We do not and cannot guarantee visa approval. F-1 student visa decisions are made solely by US Department of State consular officers based on their assessment of your application, financial capacity, and ties to Morocco. Our role is limited to helping you prepare strong documentation and interview preparation. Visa approval rates vary and are beyond our control.",
    
    "q2": "What exactly is included in DS-160 assistance?",
    "a2": "We guide you through completing the DS-160 form step-by-step, review your responses for accuracy and consistency, help you gather required documentation (I-20, financial proof, passport), and provide visa interview preparation with mock sessions. We do NOT fill out the form for you—you complete it yourself with our guidance to ensure all information is accurate and truthful.",
    
    "q3": "How long does the entire process take from start to finish?",
    "a3": "For undergraduate programs: 12-18 months total (application prep: 3-4 months, waiting for decisions: 2-4 months, visa process: 2-3 months). For graduate programs: 12-15 months. For community college: 6-9 months. These are estimates—actual timelines depend on university deadlines, your document readiness, and consular appointment availability.",
    
    "q4": "What are your service fees and payment terms?",
    "a4": "Fees vary by package: Starter, Standard, or Golden Pack. All fees are disclosed upfront before you commit. We do not have hidden charges. Payment terms and refund policies are clearly outlined in our service agreement. Contact us via WhatsApp for current pricing and a detailed breakdown.",
    
    "q5": "What is your refund policy?",
    "a5": "Refunds are governed by our published Refund Policy and depend on the stage of service delivery. Generally, once services have been rendered (consultations completed, documents reviewed, applications submitted), fees are non-refundable. Refund requests must be submitted in writing within 7 days of service commencement. Full terms are available on our Refund Policy page.",
    
    "q6": "How do you protect my personal data and documents?",
    "a6": "We take data protection seriously. All documents are stored on encrypted servers. We never share your personal information with third parties without your explicit consent, except when required to submit applications to universities. We comply with data protection regulations and ICEF standards. Your information is used solely for providing our services.",
    
    "q7": "How do you communicate with students? Do you use WhatsApp?",
    "a7": "Yes, WhatsApp is our primary communication channel for quick questions and updates during business hours (Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM, Saturday 10 AM - 4 PM Morocco time). We respond within 24-48 hours. For detailed consultations, we schedule video or in-person meetings. Email is used for formal documentation and record-keeping.",
    
    "q8": "Do you write essays or complete applications for students?",
    "a8": "No. We do not write essays or fill out applications on your behalf—that would be unethical and could result in application rejection. You write your own essays and complete your forms. We provide feedback, editing suggestions (up to 3 rounds), and ensure documents meet university standards. Our role is guidance and review, not ghost-writing.",
    
    "q9": "What documents do I need to prepare?",
    "a9": "Typical documents include: academic transcripts (certified translations), diplomas (Baccalauréat, Licence), English test scores (TOEFL/IELTS), standardized test scores (SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT), letters of recommendation (2-3), personal essays, financial documentation (bank statements, sponsor letters), and a valid passport. Specific requirements vary by program—we provide a customized checklist after your initial consultation.",
    
    "q10": "Can I choose which universities to apply to?",
    "a10": "Yes, absolutely. We provide data-driven recommendations based on your profile, but you make the final decision on which universities to apply to. We advise on realistic options where you meet minimum admission criteria, but the choice is always yours. We will not pressure you to apply to specific schools.",
    
    "q11": "What happens if I don't get admitted to any university?",
    "a11": "University admission decisions are made independently by admissions offices and cannot be guaranteed. If you are not admitted, our service fees are still non-refundable as we have provided the agreed-upon consulting services (profile assessment, application review, etc.). We recommend applying to a balanced list of reach, target, and safety schools to maximize admission chances.",
    
    "q12": "Do you help with housing and flights after visa approval?",
    "a12": "Housing and flight assistance are included only in our Standard and Golden Pack packages. We provide guidance, resources, and recommendations—but you book and pay for flights and accommodation directly with airlines and landlords. We do not act as travel agents or housing brokers. Golden Pack clients receive airport pickup coordination and first-week arrival support.",
    
    "q13": "Are you ICEF certified? What does that mean?",
    "a13": "Yes, we operate in full compliance with ICEF (International Consultants for Education and Fairs) standards, which require ethical practices, transparency, accurate information, and proper training. This means we follow industry best practices and do not make false promises about admissions or visa outcomes.",
    
    "q14": "Can I get a consultation before committing to a package?",
    "a14": "Yes. We offer a free initial consultation (15-20 minutes via WhatsApp or phone) to discuss your goals and answer basic questions. For a detailed profile assessment and university recommendations, you would need to enroll in at least the Starter package. Contact us to schedule your free consultation.",
